          This was a school project where i was supposed to design a coffee
          table book layout around a subject of my choosing. I chose to write
          about Josef MÃ¼ller Brockmann who was a pioneer in the Swiss
          international graphic design style and among the first to implement a
          grid in his graphic design work.

        <div class="card coffeetablebook-2">
          <img
            src="../wuid-portfolio-isacgustavsson/images/portfolio/brockmann2.jpg"
            alt="coffeetableobook2"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          I made my coffee table book layout span 2 spreads, 4 pages wide and
          designed it on a modular grid where i placed graphic designs made by
          Brockmann himself aswell as typographic and illustrative elements of
          my own.
